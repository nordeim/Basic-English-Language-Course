## Part 2: Basic Grammar Fundamentals

### 2.1 Overview of English Grammar

Understanding English grammar is crucial for effective communication. In this section, we will cover essential grammar rules and provide examples. You will learn about subject-verb agreement, tenses, articles, prepositions, and other fundamental concepts.

### 2.2 Subject-Verb Agreement

The subject of a sentence must agree with the verb in number (singular or plural). Consider these examples:
- **He runs** every morning.
- **She likes** chocolate.
- **They play** soccer on weekends.

**Practice:**  
Convert the following into correct sentences:
- "They is happy." → Correct form: "They are happy."
- "The dog bark loudly." → Correct form: "The dog barks loudly."

### 2.3 Verb Tenses

Verb tenses indicate when an action happens. We will cover the simple present, past, future, and continuous tenses.

#### Simple Present Tense
Used for habitual actions or general truths.
- Example: "I eat breakfast at 7 AM."
- Practice: Write five sentences about your daily routine.

#### Simple Past Tense
Used for actions that happened in the past.
- Example: "She watched a movie last night."
- Practice: Write a short paragraph about what you did yesterday.

#### Simple Future Tense
Used for actions that will happen.
- Example: "They will travel to Paris next year."
- Practice: Write three sentences about your plans for the weekend.

#### Present Continuous Tense
Used for actions that are happening right now.
- Example: "She is reading a book."
- Practice: Describe what is happening around you at this moment.

#### Past Continuous Tense
Used for actions that were happening at a specific time in the past.
- Example: "I was watching TV when the phone rang."
- Practice: Describe a situation from your past where two actions occurred simultaneously.

### 2.4 Articles (a, an, the)

Articles help specify nouns. There are two types: indefinite articles (a, an) and the definite article (the).

- **Indefinite Articles:**  
  "A" is used before words that begin with a consonant sound; "an" is used before vowel sounds.
  - Example: "a cat," "an apple."
- **Definite Article:**  
  "The" is used to refer to specific nouns.
  - Example: "the cat on the mat."
  
**Exercise:**  
Fill in the blanks:  
1. I saw ___ elephant at the zoo.  
2. Please pass me ___ salt.

### 2.5 Prepositions

Prepositions show the relationship between a noun (or pronoun) and another word in the sentence.
- Common prepositions: in, on, at, by, under, through, between.
- Example: "The book is on the table."  
- Practice: Write sentences using different prepositions to describe the location of objects in your room.

### 2.6 Pronouns and Possessives

Pronouns replace nouns to avoid repetition.
- Example: "Sarah is my friend. She is kind."
  
Possessives show ownership.
- Example: "This is John’s book."

**Exercise:**  
Rewrite the sentences by replacing the noun with the correct pronoun and possessive form:
- "Mary has a car. Mary loves Mary’s car." → "Mary has a car. She loves her car."

### 2.7 Adjectives and Adverbs

**Adjectives** describe nouns.
- Example: "It is a sunny day."
  
**Adverbs** describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
- Example: "She sings beautifully."

**Exercise:**  
Identify the adjective and adverb in the sentence: "The quick brown fox jumps swiftly."

### 2.8 Conjunctions

Conjunctions join words, phrases, or clauses.
- Coordinating conjunctions include: and, but, or, so, yet.
- Example: "I want to go, but I am tired."

**Practice:**  
Combine two simple sentences using a conjunction:  
- "I studied hard. I passed the test." → "I studied hard, so I passed the test."

### 2.9 Comparatives and Superlatives

Comparatives are used to compare two items, while superlatives are used for comparisons among three or more.
- Comparative: "She is taller than her brother."
- Superlative: "This is the best movie."

**Exercise:**  
Write three sentences comparing objects around you using both comparatives and superlatives.
