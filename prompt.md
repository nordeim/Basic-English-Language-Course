Carefully review the URL link below for a course book for teaching English. Then do some deep research to help me expand the document by completing section 1.2 by researching and adding the complete list of 500 most commonly used English words in everyday conversation. Also validate and refine the course book document to make it even more comprehensive and useful for use by a beginner learning basic English. For section 1.2, I would like you to expand it in the same format. Do not change the format of the Course Book when you produce a refined document of the actual content in the URL link below.
